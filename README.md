# arduino_aircraft_tracking
This code uses pymata4 and the opensky python api to bring airplane tracking into the physical world.
This program was originally created as a science fair project, but I may make it into something more eventually...
This code is extremely inefficient, but for my usage of this project, it does not matter; so unless I ever need to use this again it probably will not change.
